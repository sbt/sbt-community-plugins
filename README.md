# SBT Community Plugin build #

This build is geared towards building as many of the SBT community plugins at one time as possible.   It serves a few purposes:

* Testing newest versions of SBT for plugin breakage
* Ensuring SBT plugins do *not* have conflicting keys and that they can be used together
* Ensuring that for every SBT release, there is a 'latest' release of each plugin.
* Promoting a sense of unity and comradry among SBT plugin authors.
* Acting as a central location to find beahvior not in the defaults for SBT.
